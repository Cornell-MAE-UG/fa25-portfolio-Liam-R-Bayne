## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "/assets/images/Sarah's Wedding Headshot.png" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}


I am a mechanical engineering student at Cornell University driven by the belief that rigorous engineering and imaginative design can accelerate the global energy transition. My work spans plant-floor experimentation, mechanical systems design, computational modeling, and sustainable building analysis, with internships at Corning Incorporated and project leadership within Cornell University Sustainable Design. Whether redesigning tensile testing systems, modeling heat-pump retrofits for citywide decarbonization, or fabricating an indoor solar simulator, I bring a blend of analytical discipline and hands-on problem solving. I’m motivated by projects that bridge technical depth with real-world impact—especially those at the intersection of renewable energy, system optimization, and engineering innovation.
